*Full Stack Engineer | Co-Founder @ Alienous AI | AI/ML Enthusiast*

🌟 **About Me**  
I am a passionate Full Stack Engineer and Co-Founder of Alienous AI, dedicated to crafting scalable, high-performance web applications. I've successfully shipped 2 client projects from concept to launch.  

Most recently, as a Data Engineer at Kompass India, I built a centralized AI automation and crawling system from scratch—handling it solo while streamlining data processes and reducing reporting time by 20%. I also developed multi-desk email verification and validation tools that cut manual effort by 50%. Additionally, I trained and deployed ML/DL models for business solutions, like gender prediction using LLMs, all integrated into a unified internal platform.  

Beyond code, I stay active with regular workouts and prioritize collaboration, mentorship, and clear communication—often guiding junior developers. When not building tech, I'm exploring how innovation solves real-world challenges. Let's connect!
